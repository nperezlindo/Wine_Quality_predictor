Introduction & Objetives
As an Industrial Engineer and the Data Science Leader of an small consulting project, I am interested in how successful models from one industry can be adapted to others, generating valuable insights. This project utilizes a dataset titled "Wine Quality," which is publicly available for research and widely used in Data Science. With this dataset, I aim to develop a model that could potentially be applied across various industries.

The objectives are as follows:

1. Explore the dataset.
2. Determine whether any physicochemical variable, or combination of variables, can reliably predict wine quality.

Past Usage: The study by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis used two datasets created with samples of red and white wine. The inputs include objective tests (e.g., pH values), and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
Relevant Information: The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistical issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (output) variables are available (e.g., there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g., there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
